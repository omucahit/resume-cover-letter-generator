# GitHub Setup Instructions

After creating your GitHub repository, run these commands in your terminal:

```bash
# Replace 'yourusername' with your actual GitHub username
# Replace 'resume-cover-letter-generator' with your repository name (if different)

git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/resume-cover-letter-generator.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

You'll be prompted to enter your GitHub username and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled (recommended), you'll need to use a personal access token instead of your password.

## Creating a Personal Access Token (if needed)

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens → Tokens (classic)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Give your token a name (e.g., "Resume Generator App")
4. Select the "repo" scope to allow access to your repositories
5. Click "Generate token"
6. Copy the token immediately (you won't be able to see it again)
7. Use this token as your password when pushing to GitHub

## Final Steps

1. Take a screenshot of your application running
2. Save it to static/img/screenshot.png
3. Update the README.md file to uncomment the screenshot line

Your project is now on GitHub and ready for others to use or contribute to!
